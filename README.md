# Doormat cut drawings (Project for Home Design Shops)
This is the code for the project for Home Design Shops to automatically generate cut drawings from bought doormats. I used Clean Architecture to split the code into Application, Domain, Infrastructure and Presentations layers. It is part of a larger Webservices project, which I am not publishing for commercial reasons.

See my personal website for more information about the project (https://mecctech-solutions.nl/#portfolio)
